# Single-view learning methods with code

## Part A: general single-view methods with code 

### 1. NMF (non-negative matrix factorization) based methods
     NMF factorizes the non-negative data matrix into two non-negative matrices.

### 2. Graph based methods
     It contains two kinds of methods. The first kind is using a predefined graph (also resfer to the traditional spectral clustering), and performing post-processing spectral clustering or k-means. And the second kind is to learn the graph and the index matrix simultaneously.

 ### 3. Self-representation based methods
     Self-representation means that each data sample is expressed by a linear combination of other samples in the same subspace.

 ### 4. Least square regression methods

 * 4.1 NN18 Inter-class sparsity based discriminative least square regression [(matlab)](https://sites.google.com/view/jerry-wen-hit/publications)  
 
 ### 5. Tensor based methods
     The tensor is the generalization of the matrix concept. And the matrix case is a 2-order tensor.
 
 ### 6. Kernel learning based methods

 ### 6. Dictionary learning based methods
 
 ### 7. Deep learning based or network based methods
 
 ### 8. SVM based methods
 
 ### 9. Co-training based methods
