# Single-view learning methods with code

## Part A: general single-view methods with code 

### 1. NMF (non-negative matrix factorization) based methods
     NMF factorizes the non-negative data matrix into two non-negative matrices.

 * 1.2 AAAI17 Local centroids structured non-negative matrix factorization [(matlab)](https://github.com/gaoghc/Nonnegative-Matrix-Factorization)
 
### 2. Graph based methods
     It contains two kinds of methods. The first kind is using a predefined graph (also resfer to the traditional spectral clustering), and performing post-processing spectral clustering or k-means. And the second kind is to learn the graph and the index matrix simultaneously. 
     
 * 2.1 None
 

 ### 3. Self-representation based methods
     Self-representation means that each data sample is expressed by a linear combination of other samples in the same subspace.

 * 3.1 None
 
 ### 4. Tensor based methods
     The tensor is the generalization of the matrix concept. And the matrix case is a 2-order tensor.

 * 4.1 None
